Credit Card Checker is a tool that allows users to verify the validity of credit cards and display basic information about the card, such as the BIN (Bank Identification Number), PAN (Primary Account Number), and the name of the issuing bank.

## How it works?

1. The user enters the credit card number into the tool.
2. The tool analyzes the input and extracts essential details like BIN and PAN.
3. Using the BIN, the tool identifies the bank that issued the card.
4. The tool verifies if the PAN is valid and meets the conditions of the algorithm for generating credit card numbers.
